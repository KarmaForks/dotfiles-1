# colors

I'm using base16 to handle colors. Base16-shell enables you to change your
colorscheme via the commandline. Your colorscheme will be the same across
your development environment. This is very nice convienent. The Vim plugin
Lightline is the only place you will need to manaully change the colorscheme.

So, base16 is being used for:
- Shell
- Vim (as well as lightline) 
- Tmux



### Install base16-shell

I use my own forks since I am constantly pulling in and building the new themes
that get added to the base16 repos.


TODO - Add this to the setup script...

```
git clone https://github.com/jonleopard/base16-shell.git ~/.config/base16-shell
```
